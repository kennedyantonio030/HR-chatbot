# Autonomous HR Chatbot built using ChatGPT, LangChain, Pinecone and Streamlit




Companion Reading: [Creating a (mostly) Autonomous HR Assistant with ChatGPT and LangChainâ€™s Agents and Tools](https://medium.com/@stephen.bonifacio/creating-a-mostly-autonomous-hr-assistant-with-chatgpt-and-langchains-agents-and-tools-1cdda0aa70ef)

I made this prototype using Azure deployments as my company is an Azure customer.  
I created a backend file called 'hr_agent_backend_local.py' for those that does not want to use Azure.  
This is does not use any Azure components - the API is from platform.openai.com, the csv file is stored locally(i.e. on your own computer)


### Instructions:

#### How to use this repo:

1. Install python 3.10. [Windows](https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/install-python-on-windows-10-and-11#:~:text=1.,and%20download%20the%20Windows%20installer.&text=2.,is%20added%20to%20your%20path.), [Mac](https://www.codingforentrepreneurs.com/guides/install-python-on-macos/) 
2. Clone the repo to a local directory.
3. Navigate to the local directory and run this command in your terminal to install all prerequisite modules - 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
4. Input your own API keys in the hr_agent_backend_local.py file (or hr_agent_backend_azure.py if you want to use the azure version; just uncomment it in the frontend.py file)
5. Run 'streamlit run hr_agent_frontent.py' in your terminal

#### Storing Embeddings in Pinecone:

1. Create a Pinecone account in [pinecone.io](pinecone.io) - there is a free tier.  Take note of the Pinecone API and environment values.
2. Run the notebook 'store_embeddings_in_pinecone.ipynb'. Replace the Pinecone and OpenAI API keys (for  the embedding model) with your own.


### Tech Stack:

[Azure OpenAI Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/cognitive-services/openai-service) - the OpenAI service offering for Azure customers.  
[LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction.html) - development frame work for building apps around LLMs.    
[Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/) - the vector database for storing the embeddings.  
[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) - used for the front end. Lightweight framework for deploying python web apps.  
[Azure Data Lake](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/data-lake) - for landing the employee data csv files. Any other cloud storage should work just as well (blob, S3 etc).    
[Azure Data Factory](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/products/data-factory/) - used to create the data pipeline.  
[SAP HCM](https://www.sap.com/sea/products/hcm/what-is-sap-hr.html) - the source system for employee data.
